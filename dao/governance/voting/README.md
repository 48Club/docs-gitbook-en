# Voting

The vote occurs on [BNB48 DAO](https://www.bnb48.club).&#x20;

The club will periodically allocate KOGE into a voting incentive pool. Both proposers and voters will be eligible for incentives.

Every time a proposal is created, a dedicated proposal pool will be too. A default 4.8% share from the total pool will be extracted with a floor of 48 KOGE and a ceiling of 480 KOGE.&#x20;

Once the proposal finishes its voting period(quorum met), the proposer will get 4.8% from the proposal pool and then all voters split the rest according to respectively voting power. Otherwise, 4.8 KOGE will be returned and claimable by anyone.

## Propose

Everyone can make a proposal if only and only if there is a [48er NFT](48er-nft.md) held in the wallet, only the proposer must contribute to the proposal pool, 4.8 KOGE at least.

## Vote

Everyone can vote for/against a proposal if only and only if there is [KOGE ](koge-token.md)staked from the wallet.
