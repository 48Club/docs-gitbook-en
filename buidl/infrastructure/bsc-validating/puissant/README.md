description: MEV solution on BNB Smart Chain

# Puissant

Puissant is a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for efficient MEV extraction and frontrunning protection which preserves the ideals of BNB Smart Chain. Puissant provides a private communication channel between BNB Smart Chain users and validators for efficiently communicating preferred transaction order within a block.

## Why Puissant ?

In 2022, a spike in BNB Smart Chain usage has revealed a set of negative externalities brought by arb bots, as it did on Ethereum, including network congestion (i.e. p2p network load) and chain congestion (i.e. chain-reorg, empty block) caused by inefficient communication between PGA bot operators and validators for transaction order preference.

Resources are wasted, chain user experience is getting worse and meanwhile BNB holders have no chance to enjoy mev profit.

48Club decided to provide this solution. It is inspired by flashbots but improved according to BNB Smart Chain's own community philosophy.&#x20;

What's most important:&#x20;
