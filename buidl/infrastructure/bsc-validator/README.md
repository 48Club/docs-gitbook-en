Mainnet RPC works in **privacy mode**. I.e. txs sent to mainnet RPC will remain inside 48 Club and partners without being broadcasted, thus will not be packed or only packed by 48 Club and partners.

#### Pros:&#x20;

1. Front-run-resisted because arb-bot can't see your tx in advance of block sealing.
2. Wallet transparency. No programming skill is needed, just fill this RPC URL in your wallet.

#### Cons:&#x20;

1. Since only 48 Club and partners do the sealing for fonce, txs may be sealed a bit slower, it's total normal.
