# Enhanced RPC

No effort was made to hide user footprint.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Private transaction For end-user</summary>

Mainnet: `https://fonce-bsc.bnb48.club`

Testnet: `https://testnet-fonce-bsc.bnb48.club`

Txs sent to this RPC will remain inside BNB48 validator without being broadcast, thus will not be packed or only packed by BNB48.

#### Pros:&#x20;

1. Front-run-resisted because arb-bot can't see your tx in advance of block sealing.
2. Wallet transparency. No programming skill is needed, just fill this RPC URL in your wallet.

#### Cons:&#x20;

1. Mighty slow confirmation.
2. Higher gasPrice requirement, currently 15gwei.
